# Background-Separation-HslA Prototype for a New Background Separation Technology
This is a tool for separating backgrounds using a unique dematting technology that differs from traditional chroma keying and AI-based methods. At its core, it uses a gradient-based transparency calculated in the HSL color space and a color correction formula to compensate for background color bleed. This approach achieves a natural separation without leaving artifacts like halos, shadows, or fine-line distortions, which are common issues.
This tool is currently a prototype and a foundation for a new background separation technology. I am a beginner in programming, and I would love for all of you to help improve this technology and turn it into an even better tool.
To the best of my knowledge, this specific method did not exist in any tools I found. However, there is a possibility that a similar technique might already exist somewhere.
